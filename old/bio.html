	<h1>Rifat Ralfi Salhon</h1>
	<p>Looking at my photo album you will see a fascinated toddler as young as 2 years old, sitting in front of a giant PC. I didn't exactly know the marvels of the virtual world then, but I was amazed by the feedback I received from the machine every time my fingers brushed through the keyboard. Ever since, the virtual world and its mechanics never ceased to fascinate me.</p>
	<p>Hi, my name is Ralfi. I was born on 6th of December, 1997. I am passionate about a lot of things in life; such as the internet, music, anything technology, magic tricks, games, comfortable socks, memes, and much more...</p>
	<p>I currently study at Tufts University. This is an incredible opportunity for me, as I am from Turkey. I have lived in Turkey my entire life, of course besides the last year and a half that I spent at Tufts.</p>
	<p>I love meeting new people, throwing great parties, and always learning new things.</p>
	<p>I also love Ming and COMP20</p>
